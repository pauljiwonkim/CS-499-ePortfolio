**Description**: Databases focus on implementing and designing a well-structured and efficient system for storing, managing, and retrieving data. This includes maintaining data integrity, optimizing query performance, and ensuring that the system can handle diverse data needs effectively.

**Enhancement**: For the database enhancement, I added the functionality of removing items from the SQLite database. This involved implementing a function that handles item deletions based on their unique identifiers or category. I also introduced additional functions that enables more specific queries and data retrieval, which will support future features like report generation.
As mentioned in Data Structure and Algorithm enhancement, I've also added a feature where a long press on a category or item will highlight it which complements the remove items enhancement.

**Justification**: This enhancement improves the app by adding a crucial item deletion feature, ensuring that the database accurately reflects the current inventory. It also demonstrates my ability to handle complex database operations and maintain data integrity, which is crucial for effective database management and future feature development.

**Reflection**: Working on this artifact provided me with valuable experience in database management and maintaining data consistency. Implementing the deletion feature deepened my understanding of SQLite operations and integration with the appâ€™s user interface, enhancing my skills in handling database queries and setting the stage for future improvements.
