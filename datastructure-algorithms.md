**Description**: Data Structures and Algorithms focuses on efficiently organizing and processing data to address problems effectively. This encompasses selecting appropriate data structures, optimizing algorithms, and ensuring that operations are executed swiftly and accurately. 

In my original artifact, my app utilized fundamental CRUD operations, (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and lists as its primary algorithms and data structures. 

**Enhancement**: For the Data Structures and Algorithms enhancement, I implemented a sorting algorithm to my code so the user may sort items alphabetically in ascending or descending order. 

By applying this sorting algorithm, items are accurately sorted and efficiently managed, improving the overall functionality of the application.

**After Sort Ascending**

**After Sort Descending**

I've also added a feature where a long press on a category or item will highlight it. This feature complements the sorting algorithm enhancement.

**Justification**: By implementing the Timsort algorithm, the application's sorting capabilities is improved and provides an efficient and accurate method for ordering items alphabetically. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to apply advanced algorithms to improve data management and overall performance, ensuring that users can sort items quickly and correctly in both ascending and descending order.

**Reflection**: Enhancing the data structures and algorithms in the app deepened my understanding of how to efficiently manage and manipulate data. It underscored the importance of choosing appropriate algorithms and data structures to improve performance and reliability.
